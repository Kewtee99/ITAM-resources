# What is an Asset Check In Check Out System?

*By Emily | Published on May 15, 2025*

Managing IT assets can be chaotic without the right tools. An asset check-in/check-out system tracks equipment, boosts efficiency, and prevents losses. This article explores what these systems are, how they work, and their benefits, with real-world use cases for businesses.

## What is an Asset Check In Check Out System?

An asset check-in/check-out system tracks physical assets like laptops, tools, or vehicles. Each asset gets a unique identifier (e.g., barcode, QR code, or RFID tag) linked to software like [AssetLoom](https://assetloom.com). The software stores details (ID, location, status), logs transactions, and generates reports for audits or compliance.

When an employee needs an asset, they scan its tag to check it out, logging who took it and when. Upon return, the asset is scanned to check it in, updating its status. This ensures accountability and visibility.

## How Does It Work?

1. **Asset Tagging**: Assets are labeled with barcodes, QR codes, or RFID tags. For example, a laptop’s QR code links to its model and warranty.
2. **Software Setup**: Software like AssetLoom stores asset data. Scanning a tag updates the system (e.g., “Laptop #123 is with marketing”).
3. **Check-Out Process**: Employees scan the tag to borrow an asset, logging their name and due date.
4. **Check-In Process**: Returning the asset involves scanning it again, noting any issues (e.g., damage).
5. **Reporting**: The system generates reports on asset usage, overdue items, or audit compliance.

## Key Benefits

- **Efficiency**: Check-ins/outs take seconds, not hours.
- **Loss Prevention**: Tracking reduces theft or misplacement.
- **Compliance**: Logs ensure regulatory adherence.
- **Scalability**: Suitable for 10 or 10,000 assets.
- **Peace of Mind**: Always know where assets are.

## Real-World Use Cases

1. **Marketing Agency (30 Laptops)**:
   - **Challenge**: Laptops misplaced during client visits, tracked via spreadsheets.
   - **Solution**: QR codes on laptops linked to AssetLoom. Freelancers scan to check out/in, logging details.
   - **Outcome**: 90% reduction in lost devices, saving time.

2. **Community College (500 Assets)**:
   - **Challenge**: Projectors and tablets borrowed inconsistently, audits took days.
   - **Solution**: Barcode labels scanned with Lansweeper software. Faculty log check-outs/ins.
   - **Outcome**: Audits reduced from 3 days to 4 hours, 95% on-time returns.

3. **Tech Firm (10,000 Servers)**:
   - **Challenge**: Tracking server assignments across data centers.
   - **Solution**: RFID tags and ServiceNow ITAM track check-outs to teams.
   - **Outcome**: Zero unauthorized access, downtime minimized.

4. **Construction Company (500 Tools)**:
   - **Challenge**: Tools lost on job sites, delaying projects.
   - **Solution**: RFID tags with Asset Panda software for bulk check-outs.
   - **Outcome**: 30% fewer replacements, faster project timelines.

## Getting Started

1. **Assess Needs**: Count assets and prioritize goals (e.g., compliance, speed).
2. **Choose Software**: Options like AssetLoom (affordable) or ServiceNow ITAM (enterprise) offer QR code/barcode support.
3. **Tag Assets**: Label each asset with a barcode or QR code.
4. **Train Team**: Teach staff to scan tags (10–60 minutes).
5. **Start Small**: Test with one department, then expand.
6. **Integrate with ITSM**: Sync with tools like Jira for streamlined workflows.

## Wrapping Up

Asset check-in/check-out systems are game-changers for IT asset management. They save time, reduce losses, and ensure compliance. Whether you’re a small business or a large enterprise, tools like [AssetLoom](https://assetloom.com) make asset tracking effortless.
